Using stock data from [nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/nvda/historical), animate the prices of Nvidia, AMD, & Intel over time. Each of their daily prices can be found in the [./data](https://github.com/KeithGalli/time-series-animations/blob/master/data) folder.

The animation is created in [animated_graph.py](https://github.com/KeithGalli/time-series-animations/blob/master/animated_graph.py)
