Using the [UN World Population Prospects](https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/MostUsed) dataset, we can create a bar chart race graph with Matplotlib.

the animation code is in [bar_chart.py]([https://github.com/KeithGalli/time-series-animations/blob/master/bar_chart.py](https://github.com/jangamvivek/time-series-animations/blob/main/population_bar_chart.py))
